# EmotionsAnalyzer
This project involves building a sentiment analyzer that allows users to input text and receive an emotional evaluation. The tool leverages two main techniques: firstly, it harnesses the power of the ChatGPT API to analyze the textual content and discern its tone and emotional polarity. Secondly, it utilizes the TextBlob Python library, which employs natural language processing techniques to conduct a more detailed sentiment analysis. The combination of these two techniques delivers a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the sentiments expressed in the input text.
